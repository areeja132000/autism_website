              <p>         
                Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a proven and effective approach that focuses on understanding and 
                modifying behaviors. Widely used in therapy and education, ABA utilizes techniques to encourage positive 
                behaviors while minimizing negative ones. It's especially beneficial for individuals with developmental 
                challenges, helping them develop essential life skills and improve overall quality of life.

              <h3>Play therapy</h3>   
              <p>
                Play therapy is a therapeutic approach that harnesses the power of play to help individuals, often children, 
                cope with emotional and behavioral challenges. By engaging in play, they can express their thoughts, emotions, 
                and experiences in a non-directive and comfortable manner. Play therapy provides a safe space for exploration, 
                creativity, and healing, allowing individuals to work through issues, build resilience, and develop healthier 
                ways of coping.

              <h3>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h3>   
              <p>
                Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) tailored for autistic children is a goal-oriented approach that helps them 
                manage thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. This form of therapy equips them with practical strategies to navigate 
                challenges, reduce anxiety, and enhance social interactions. By focusing on their individual strengths and needs, 
                CBT empowers autistic kids to develop crucial life skills and build a stronger foundation for their overall 
                well-being.
