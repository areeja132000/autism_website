            <p>I am a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst with extensive experience working with children 
              with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and various developmental needs. My expertise spans 
              special education classrooms, small groups, and one-on-one settings. I excel in conducting 
              assessments and designing interventions rooted in the principles of applied behavior analysis.
              My advanced knowledge of ASD allows me to understand its impact on behavior development, daily living, 
              communication, and social skills. I am skilled in creating individualized plans that cater to 
              each child's unique requirements. Moreover, I am proficient in providing training to professionals, 
              parents, caregivers, and community mediators. With a deep understanding of the characteristics 
              of ASD, I strive to make a positive difference in the lives of children by implementing 
              effective strategies and interventions. I am passionate about helping individuals with 
              developmental needs reach their fullest potential and lead fulfilling lives.</p>

                <p>I believe in unlocking every child's potential and inspiring excellence and well-being. My main focus is 
                  fostering communication between parents and children, understanding its value. I prioritize social skills, 
                  emotional regulation, cognitive development, and mental health to help children comprehend the world 
                  around them. Confidence building for enthusiastic learning is crucial, so I keep sessions active and 
                  engaging to encourage creativity. I collaborate with the child's school, attending meetings if necessary, 
                  to support their learning needs comprehensively. With over two years of experience in Applied Behavior 
                  Analysis (ABA) and more than 10 years of tutoring neurotypical, ASD, and ADHD children, I have developed 
                  unique techniques for therapy sessions. Alongside my 40 hours of registered behavior technician training, 
                  I aim to become a registered behavior technician after completing my supervision. Ultimately, I aspire to 
                  be a family psychotherapist specializing in promoting healthy life balance for families with children with 
                  developmental disabilities. I currently hold a BA in Psychology and am pursuing my honors degree.</p>

                <p>I am a dynamic professional currently pursuing a Master of Public Health degree at Schulich School of Medicine 
                  and Dentistry, Western University. My academic journey began with a double major in Neuroscience and Psychology 
                  at the University of Guelph. Known for my innovation and responsible approach, I bring these qualities to every 
                  task I undertake. As an Instructor Therapist, I have had the privilege to gain valuable experience and developed 
                  a passion for supporting individuals with developmental challenges especially ASD. With aspirations to become a 
                  speech-language pathologist, I aim to bridge the gap between speech-language pathology and public health. Public 
                  health plays a crucial role in promoting the overall well-being of individuals and communities. By integrating 
                  public health principles and practices with the field of speech-language pathology, we can enhance the 
                  understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of autism. I am dedicated to bridging these fields and working towards 
                  a future where individuals with autism receive comprehensive support, where their voices are heard, and where 
                  their communication needs are met to promote their overall health and quality of life.
